        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Nathan Perch, a 24-year-old Systems Management and Security student at NSCC Institute of Technology and an employee at Superstore for the past 2 years. I've been having a blast learning about web development, playing around with PowerShell scripts, and getting the hang of databases. Outside of screens, you'll catch me farming, biking, longboarding, and diving into the world of anime.</p>
        <p>In school, I've picked up skills in web development, programming, Windows administration, and Networking. My goal is straightforward: to do well and make sure I can support myself, friends, and family. Come along as I keep having fun blending my tech interests with real-life applications.</p>

                <img src="portfolioimages/1st webpage.png" alt="Image 1">
                <p>This was my very first attempt at a webpage, everyone in class had to make a short about me page talking<br> about yourself and what your interests are.</p>

                <h3>Nikola Tesla Webpage</h3>
                <img src="portfolioimages/niktes.gif" alt="Image 2">
                <p>This is a gif (sorry for the quality) of a Webpage I had to redesign. <br>
                Its a biography of Nikola Tesla, I sectioned all of the paragraphs and inserted images keeping<br>
                 the sizes proportionate. I also added some animations along with the color scheme,<br>
                 links were also embedded at the top of the webpage directing towards some fun material about Nikola Tesla.

                <p> Heres another gif of a webpage assignmentI had to create. We were given an image to base it off of along with thew images needed to create it.
                    I wrote the HTML and CSS files for it, styled and added some animations to the lower image boxes.
