        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Nathan Perch, a 24-year-old Systems Management and Security student at NSCC Institute of Technology and an employee at Superstore for the past 2 years. I've been having a blast learning about web development, playing around with PowerShell scripts, and getting the hang of databases. Outside of screens, you'll catch me farming, biking, longboarding, and of course jamming to music. Computer knowledge is something I've always recognized I had more than others as I've grown up in an environment with alot of computers as my Dad was a Web Developer on the side. Though I'm trying my best to expand my horizons.</p>
        <p>In school, I've picked up skills in web development, programming, Windows administration, and Networking. My goal is straightforward: to do well and make sure I can support myself, friends, and family. Come along as I keep having fun blending my tech interests with real-life applications. Some day when Im I would also like to set up my own Computer Cafe. With this course I'm hoping to gain the knowledge that I will be able to setup a lot of that on my own. Making a website, setting up POS systems, or general networking for the Cafe.</p>
        <p> Here's a brief description of some of the skills I've learned at jobs in the passed few years<br>

                Its a biography of Nikola Tesla, I sectioned all of the paragraphs and inserted images keeping<br>
                 the sizes proportionate. I also added some animations along with the color scheme,<br>
                 links were also embedded at the top of the webpage directing towards some fun material about Nikola Tesla.
