        <h2>About Saving the Ocean</h2>
        <p>The ocean is a vital part of our planet, providing habitat for diverse marine life and regulating the Earth's climate. However, it faces numerous threats such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change.</p>
        <p>Here are five major points to consider:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Plastic Pollution</h3>
        <p>Description: Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of plastic materials in the environment, particularly in oceans and other bodies of water. It is a significant environmental issue that poses a threat to marine life, ecosystems, and human health.</p>
        <p>Impact: Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injury or death. Plastic particles can also enter the food chain, affecting both aquatic and human life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Overfishing</h3>
        <p>Description: Overfishing occurs when fish are caught at a rate that exceeds their natural reproduction, leading to a decline in fish populations. It is a result of unsustainable fishing practices that can disrupt marine ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Impact: Overfishing can deplete fish stocks, affecting biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing. It can also lead to the collapse of fisheries and disrupt the balance of marine ecosystems.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Coral Bleaching</h3>
        <p>Description: Coral bleaching is a phenomenon where corals lose their vibrant colors due to stress, often caused by elevated sea temperatures. The loss of colorful algae living in coral tissues can have detrimental effects on coral health.</p>
        <p>Impact: Coral bleaching weakens corals and makes them more susceptible to diseases. Prolonged bleaching events can result in coral death, affecting the biodiversity and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Climate Change Impact</h3>
        <p>Description: Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, contribute to the buildup of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming and climate change.</p>
        <p>Impact: Climate change impacts the oceans through rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and altered weather patterns. It poses threats to marine life, disrupts ecosystems, and contributes to more frequent and intense extreme weather events.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Sea Level Rise</h3>
        <p>Description: Sea level rise is the increase in the average level of the Earth's oceans. It is primarily driven by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater due to warming.</p>
        <p>Impact: Sea level rise can lead to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and the submergence of low-lying areas. It poses risks to coastal communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure.</p>
