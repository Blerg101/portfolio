        <h2>About Saving the Ocean</h2>
        <p>The ocean is a vital part of our planet, providing habitat for diverse marine life and regulating the Earth's climate. However, it faces numerous threats such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change.</p>
        <p>Here are five major points to consider:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Plastic Pollution</h3> - Description: Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of plastic materials in the environment, particularly in oceans and other bodies of water.<br>
            It is a significant environmental issue that poses a threat to marine life, ecosystems, and human health.<br>
            Impact: Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic debris, leading to injury or death. Plastic<br>
            particles can also enter the food chain, affecting both aquatic and human life.</li>
            <li><h3>Overfishing</h3> - Description: Overfishing occurs when fish are caught at a rate that exceeds their natural<br>
            reproduction, leading to a decline in fish populations. It is a result of unsustainable fishing practices that can disrupt marine ecosystems.<br>
            Impact: Overfishing can deplete fish stocks, affecting biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent on fishing.<br>
            It can also lead to the collapse of fisheries and disrupt the balance of marine ecosystems.</li>
            <li><h3>Coral Bleaching</h3> - Description: Coral bleaching is a phenomenon where corals lose their vibrant colors due<br>
            to stress, often caused by elevated sea temperatures. The loss of colorful algae living in coral tissues can have detrimental effects on coral health.<br>
            Impact: Coral bleaching weakens corals and makes them more susceptible to diseases. Prolonged bleaching events can result in coral death, affecting the<br>
            biodiversity and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.</li>
            <li><h3>Climate Change Impact</h3> - Description: Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions.<br>
            Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, contribute to the buildup of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming and climate change. <br>
            Impact: Climate change impacts the oceans through rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and altered weather patterns. It poses threats to marine life,<br>
            disrupts ecosystems, and contributes to more frequent and intense extreme weather events.</li>
            <li><h3>Sea Level Rise</h3> - Description: Sea level rise is the increase in the average level of the Earth's oceans.<br>
            It is primarily driven by the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater due to warming. <br>
            Impact: Sea level rise can lead to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and the submergence of low-lying areas.<br>
            It poses risks to coastal communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure.</li></ol>
